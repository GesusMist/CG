My town's theme is: Mr. Copper's enjoying his life on an isolated island, where he grew up.
Recently he's planning on building something new, so he asked for a excavator from the mainland.
Well, life on the island can be boring, but the scene of nature is extraodinary.  
You can observe Mr.Copper and his animals, his old house, and... maybe his rusted swing.
When you are tired of busy city life, what about to sit and see how cows comsume grass?
