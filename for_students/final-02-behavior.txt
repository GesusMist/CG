Three different behaviors that you made:
1. Coconut would fall when they are mature and roll into the sea and soon grow again.
2. Cow can walk, swing its tail, turn around, eat grass
3. The excavator keeps dig sand and throw them into the sea

One behavior that is not simple:
Coconut would randomly fall when they are mature and roll into the sea and soon grow again.
You can expect about in 16 seconds a coconut to fall and 10 seconds to grow at 1.00 speed

If timeOfDay are in the evening hours, the skybox would change to galaxy sky.
