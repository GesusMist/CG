Advanced Thing: Complex Object& Complex Behavior  (#2&#3)
example: LookAt: man-1
I call him Mr. copper, the land owner, he sometimes walk around and some times go get a snap. (A rather complicated finite state machine )
You will want to see how he wake up, it's cool and smooth.
(He would be defaultly lying and wake up if you fresh the page ) 

Advanced Thing: Complex Behavior  (#2)
example: LookAt: cow-1
It behaves much like cows in Minecraft. It can walk, turn, eat grass, and you can ride it!
This is implemented using a finite state machine 

Advanced Thing: Use Noise (#12)
example: LookAt: cow-1
The cow's pattern are generated using Perlin noise

Advanced Thing: Complex Adaption (#5)
example: lookAt : Island
It's the water. But lookAt water doesnot work well.
It's a really complicated shader made by Three's author, I forked it and made some changes and applied here. It took effort to fit it in (eg: run and stop with the UI)

Advanced Thing: Dynamic Texture Map (16#)
Sadly it's not in the scene because it slows the performance significantly.
But it's in ./crystalBall.js check it out!
